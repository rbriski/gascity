# Work items: stores return domain objects

Ordered strangler migration. Each item: **Fable design → Opus impl (TDD) → Fable
red-team before commit.** Acceptance = the item's checks pass AND the CI census
ratchet (WI-0) records progress (never regresses). See `spec.md` for the contract.

Status legend: `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done.

Open PRs from the earlier leak-cleanup fold into this plan (do NOT double-build):
- **Merge as-is / keepers:** O1 #4055 (dead wake helpers — deletes ~500 LOC of the
  session surface first), O9 #4048 (constant), O3 #4049 (graph-class field codec,
  out-of-metric), O5 #4050 (orders opener), O7 #4051 (session codec vocabulary).
- **Fold as steps:** O2 #4057, O4 #4058, O6 #4056.
- **Rework:** O8 #4052 (keep `SweepStale`; replace the `DecodeShadow(b).ID` reads).

---

## WI-0 — CI census ratchet (enforcement baseline) `[x]`
`cmd/gc/typedclass_edge_guard_test.go`, Tier-1 only (§6.1). Checked-in
`map[file]count` of typed-class codec/raw-export needles across the interior dirs,
excluding the edge set; increase or new file fails; decrease fails until ratcheted.
Header documents the §5 exemption census.
**Acceptance:** test passes on current tree (pins today's baseline); a synthetic
added `InfoFromPersistedBead(` in an interior file makes it fail.

## WI-1 — Nudges class `[ ]`  (smallest blast radius; pilot)
Rework O8. Add `NudgeShadow.Open` (bead-authoritative) + `Store.StaleShadowsBefore(before, limit, liveExcludeIDs) -> []NudgeShadow` (carries the live-flock-queue exclusion + a count/dry-run twin, preserving the cross-phase shared close budget). Keep `Store.SweepStale`. Migrate `nudge_mail_sweep.go` sweep+count loops onto the typed reads; delete `nudge_beads.go` adapters + `FindBead`/`FindBeadIncludingTerminal`/`DecodeShadow`/`StaleCandidatesBefore` (zero non-test callers after rework). `Find`/`FindIncludingTerminal(nudgeID)` stay as this class's `Get(handle)` (handle = durable nudge ID). Preserve nil-receiver no-op + flock-transaction callability.
**Residual (blocked on WI-4):** `blockedQueuedNudgeReason`, `nextWaitDeliveryAttempt` crack session-class wait beads → close when `WaitInfo` ships.
**Acceptance:** nudges census → 0 for its needles (minus the documented session residual); typed reads pin `NudgeShadow` fields; byte-identical terminal writes.

## WI-2 — Messaging class `[x]`
Add whole-operation retention methods to `beadmail` returning **counts**:
`SweepReadMessagesBefore(cutoff, limit, closeReason)`, `CountReadMessagesBefore(cutoff, limit)`, `PurgeReadMessageWisps(cutoff)`. Export an `IsMessageBead` predicate (or use `coordclass.Classify`). Migrate `nudge_mail_sweep.go` mail phases + split the mail arm OUT of `wisp_gc.go`'s graph-owned `purgeExpiredBeadRoots` onto `PurgeReadMessageWisps`; swap `order_dispatch.go:1680` inline `Type=="message"` for the predicate. Delete `beadmail.ReadMessagesBefore`/`ReadMessageWispEntries`.
**Residual (owned by WI-4/6):** mail identity/recipient resolution over raw session beads in `cmd_mail.go`/`handler_mail.go` converges on the typed session mailbox surface (O7 vocabulary).
**Acceptance:** messaging retention loops live inside `beadmail`; the two raw exports gone; graph GC undisturbed (mail arm already runs against `mailStore` separately).

## WI-3 — Orders class `[x]`
Land O5 first. Then on `orders.Store`: `Get(handle) -> OrderRun`; `RunDetail(handle) -> {OrderRun, convergence.GateOutput}`; bulk **Live**-tier `RecentRunsAll(limit)`/`OpenRuns()` (fold the perf-critical tracking index onto `OrderRun`, NOT per-handle Gets); sweep reads `StaleOpenRuns`/`OrphanedOpenRuns`/`ClosedRunsForRetention` + `CloseRuns(ids, reason)` batch-with-verify + `DeleteRun`; `MarkFailed(runID, outcome, cursor)` (one Update, byte-identical to `markTrackingFailure`). `OrderRun` grows `UpdatedAt` + legacy `order:<title>` name fallback.
**MANDATORY (critique correction 1):** `HasOpenWork(scoped)`, `LastRun`, `Cursor` are **mixed orders+graph reads** (event seq labels are stamped on graph wisp roots) — implement them as two-class edge reads taking `(OrdersStore, GraphStore)`; the union List + wisp-descendant walk stay inside the edge; only typed verdicts escape. **Do NOT** "rebase onto `beads.OrdersStore`" as a single class. Characterization test: an order whose only evidence is a wisp/molecule root (no tracking bead) still reports correct last-run + cursor against two DISTINCT stores.
Migrate `order_dispatch.go` index/sweeps/close-verify, `cmd_order.go` cursor reads, `internal/api` orders read path; rebase `LastRunFuncForStore`/`CursorFuncForStore` as two-class; delete `unwrapOrdersStores`.
**Acceptance:** orders census → 0; every new read declares its tier (Live pinned by a bypass test); the two-class characterization test passes.

## WI-4 — Sessions / Waits (greenfield; unblocks WI-1 & WI-2 residuals) `[x]`
Land O6. Promote to `session.Store` handle-taking methods: `GetWait(handle) -> WaitInfo`, `WaitsForSession(sessionID)`, `ListWaits(state, session)`, `CreateWait(spec) -> WaitInfo`; move `CancelWaits`/`ReassignWaits`/`WakeSession(sessionID)` from package funcs taking `(beads.Store, bead)` to Store methods taking **handles** (`WakeSession` becomes a store-internal transaction: lifecycle-conflict check + wait cancel + metadata batch, replacing four callers that fetch the raw bead first). Move O6's residual write codecs (`retryClosedWait`, `setWaitTerminalState`, `cmdSessionWait` meta map) into the store.
**WIRE:** typed Huma `/v0/waits` endpoint + DTO replacing `Client.ListBeads(label=gc:wait)`/`GetBead` in `cmd_wait.go`. **(critique correction):** make 404-on-new-route a `ShouldFallbackForRead`-eligible/capability-probed condition (rolling-deploy safety); keep the label read serving through a deprecation window; carry `AgeSeconds` in the typed `CachedRead` envelope; migrate the local `doWaitListFallback` leg onto the session front door in the same step.
**Acceptance:** wait census → 0 in `cmd_wait.go`/`waits.go`; `/v0/waits` + fallback both typed; WI-1 & WI-2 wait residuals close.

## WI-5 — Sessions / Reconciler core (large; already mid-flight) `[ ]`

> WI-5 waves: W0 (fold O1+O2+O4) ✅ · W1 (ApplyPatchInfo cutover) ✅ · W2 (leaf reads) → W3 (mixed splits) → W4 (ordered-slice/snapshot) → W5 (lockstep drop + oracle-sibling deletion). Relocation-guard regression from WI-4 fixed (5fb00e5d3).
Fold O2 + O4. `ApplyPatch` **returns the refreshed `Info` as a LOCAL fold** (not re-Get); status-close keeps a `Get`. Migrate the remaining ~37 `session_reconcile.go` decision helpers + the `session_wake.go` drain family + `session_lifecycle_parallel.go` async-start commit protocol onto `infoByID` (Info first grows the enumerable vocabulary those compares need). Retire the ordered `[]beads.Bead` working set (`session_reconciler.go:1411-1433`) onto `infoByID`; delete the `sessionBeadSnapshot` raw half + the ~20 single-site `InfoFromPersistedBead` wrappers + `infoLookupFromBeadLookup` shim. Every migrated read gets the `*_info_equiv_test.go` oracle treatment; the raw classifier oracle siblings are deleted last (unblocks Tier-3 unexport). **Do NOT attempt in one PR** — leaf-first waves.
**Acceptance:** `session_reconcile.go`/`session_wake.go` bead-free (mixed files stay off Tier-2 with in-code census); tick budget preserved (no re-Get); oracles green.

## WI-6 — Sessions / API + Worker + Periphery `[ ]`
`session.Store`: `ListAll(opts)` (carries `IncludeClosed`/`Sort`/`Live`/`Limit`; cache-first union ported from `cache_read_model.go`; characterization-pinned) + `GetPersistedResponse(handle)` (retire `Manager.GetWithPersistedResponse`/`GetWithBead`). Migrate `cache_read_model.go`/`handler_sessions.go`/`huma_handlers_sessions_query.go`/`session_resolution.go`/`handler_status.go` (fold O7). Worker: `Factory.SessionByHandle`/`SessionByInfo`, catalog off bead feeds; Manager stops accepting bead feeds and returning `(Info, Bead)` pairs. Periphery: `build_desired_state`/`pool` cluster (per-parameter split: session params → `Info`, work slices stay `[]beads.Bead`; `bindPoolSessionTriggerBead` returns a typed patch + fixes its write routing), `session_beads` repair lane, sleep/idle/name-lookup collapse; mail identity residual onto the typed session mailbox surface (closes WI-2 residual).
**Acceptance:** session interior (minus §5 exemptions) bead-free; API/worker on typed Store; dashboard perf tier preserved (`make dashboard-check` + no per-request bd hit regression).

## WI-7 — Front-door flip + compiler endgame `[ ]`
`cmd/gc/class_store.go` + `api.State` accessors flip from `beads.XStore` wrappers to domain stores (`sessionsFrontDoor() *session.Store`, `ordersFrontDoor() *orders.Store`, `nudgesFrontDoor() *nudgequeue.Store`; mail already via `newCityMailProvider`), built from `resolve*Store` outputs (preserve capability assertions). Unexport the per-class codecs; convert the WI-0 ratchet guards into permanent zero-count pins; `frontdoor_di_guard_test.go` transition lists become permanent.
**Acceptance:** typed-class codecs unexported (compiler-enforced boundary); census tests are zero-pins; work/graph accessors unchanged.

## Deferred follow-ups (tracked, not yet done)
- **WI-3 two-class graph wiring:** the orders `LastRun`/`Cursor`/`HasOpenWork` edge is built to take an orders leg + a graph leg, but every call site currently passes the orders store as its own graph leg and `resolveGraphStore` is not wired in — so graph-split correctness is deferred (byte-identical to before for single-store cities). Wire `resolveGraphStore` into `orderFrontDoorsForStores`/`orderFrontDoorsForTypedStores` + the `order_dispatch`/`cmd_order`/`huma_handlers_orders` call sites, with a split-city characterization test, before Tier-3 unexport of the order codecs.
- **WI-3 residuals** (order-class debt in the census): `RunFromTrackingBead(` in `huma_handlers_orders.go` and `MaxSeqFromLabels(` in `cmd_order.go`/`huma_handlers_orders.go` — the API history/detail federation + `bdCursor` path; close with the WI-6 API read-model + wire-DTO work.
